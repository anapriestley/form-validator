I have worked on this form validation problem in a real world way. This to me means working in the same way I currently use in my role at phil&teds. My role is very diverse, and often rather stretched for time. This means that while I would love to have the time to build all javascript from scratch, I am far more likely to utilise jQuery and javascript plugins that fit the criteria and adjust as required.

My problem solving style is to google anything that stops me from completing a task, and try out a number of solutions until I crack the issue.

I have taken this approach here as well. While I have called on the jQuery form validation plugin (http://www.formvalidator.net/) I have done so for time saving, and for ease of use.

I have also added HTML5 form validation where appropriate, and styled the form to be more appealing, and utilising responsive layouts to ensure the form is easy to use at all device sizes.

# Browser support
I have also tested the following browsers with successful results:
Chrome Version 59.0.3071.86
Safari Version 10.1
Firefox Version 53.0.3 (64-bit)
IE9 onwards
